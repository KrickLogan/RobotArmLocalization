This is the training script for the model. The output from this system is used in the localization package.

# Training Script

This model trains on nearly 300 images, annotated in the way denoted in the markdown documents included in this folder. The dataset which this was trained on is not included in this submission. There is a requirements file within this directory which can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt` and with some work, we could provide all the images and their corresponding masks if you wished to run this. We are including this work in the sumission but not considering it as part of the "operational software" part of the submission.

Some notable inclusions are the markdown documents included here which describe the training and mask making procedure.
