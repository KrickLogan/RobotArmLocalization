Introduction
============


The software intakes image masks and detect the claw of the robot, object of interest and base of the claw. The package uses the trained RCNN to make detections on an image. The output generated by RCNN model is stored and organized by labeling for further manipulation. It creates bounding boxes around the detected item and give a label along with a confidence score of the prediction. The software then calculates the distance between base to object and base to claw using depth data provided from camera. Using these vectors, it applies rotations to the vector of the detected object to get position of object in terms of X, Y and Z coordinate system.

The software provides the positioning coordinates by calculating distance relative to base of the robot arm. The coordinate distance of the claw provided by positioning system of the software is actual distance between center point of the base and claw of the robot arm. Similarly, the coordinate of object is distance center point of the base and object of the robot arm. Center points are calculated by using the data from detection from RCNN model.
